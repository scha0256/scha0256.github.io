        <!-- paragraph about me -->
    <p>
        My name is Natasha Schartner. I was born on March 12<sup>th</sup> in Windsor, Ontario. I grew up in Leamington Ontario with my parents and sister Raylene. I attended high school at <abbr title="United Mennonite Educational Institute">UMEI</abbr> and graduated in 2020. I decided to attend the Algonquin College, <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program as I have always loved design. 
    </p>
    <P>I have no experience in webdesign, or coding. I was nervous entering this course, due to my complete lack of experience. In the other cousers this program provides I have much more experience. I worked on a robotics team in high school as the <abbr title="Public Relations">PR</abbr> representative. I learned a lot from this time and it inspired me to try this program. 
    </P>
