    <p>
        This portfolio consists of my best work obtaining to design and photography. My objective is to design for companies to meet visions and create unique, inspiring graphics.
    <br>
    <br>
        I enjoys working with layouts and making effective while also attractive products.
    <br>
    <br>
        Taking pictures is a side hobby of mine. I find the best way to capture a feeling is with a picture. I often base my designs off of photos I have taken. The two work together to make great work.
