<!-- Creating the Site -->
I created my icecream shop with a colour scheme and mood in mind. I wanted to make sure the site was accesible to all types of users. The icecream store had to be simple as it is for informational purposes and to get a feel of what the shop is about. 
I created the site using mostly an image with text/about ifo layout. I didnt want to overcomplicate the layout. The Home page and about pages are simple for informational purposes. Short bits of information for people wo want to simply pull up the ste and get a quick look. 
Than the Our Icecream page was a bit more packed with info. I wanted customers to know what the store offreed with quick look at what was avalible. I added a caropusel for a mood creator. people base their thoughts a lot of the time off what thye see. Using images I can get them to turn their attention to that Old feel of icecream shops. 
The Contact or Find Us page has a stacked layout. This makes it easy to find the header section you are looking for. 

<!-- Problems I ran into -->
The main Problem I ran into was the layout change of the footer. I had a hard time getting the icons and nav text to wrap. I eventualy solved this with changing my html format to cater to the css. The problem was the diffrent elements were in seperate divs. The css could not wrap elements that were in seperate divs. 

Another problem I ran into was the nav logo. When using the bootstrap class it placed my logo lower than the rest of the nav elemsnts. I had to play with my own css styles to fi this problem. I found I had a couple classes in plave before ading th bootstrap that overrid the bootstrap causing the logo to change its form. 

<!-- What I learned -->
In this course I have learned some great new tools and perfected some one fromlast term that needed help. In this icecream shop site I learned that I have really memorized a lot of classes and elements that I before would have had to look up. At this pont I am happy with the swift way i am able to write a page with thinking about it too much.
